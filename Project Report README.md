Jatesh Joshi -> 
: Used JavaFX to make the welcome, login, signup pages as well as the trip page. Utilized features such as vbox buttons, gridpane for the stage for all these screens.
Validated user data with if-else conditions but was inspired by a class assignment to validate the password using user-defined exceptions. 
: Username is generated by the system in the format first name intital, last name initial, and 4 random numbers. 
: OOP concepts utilized: Inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism. (The four pillars).
: UI backgrounds were png and jpg extension images that were integrated using FXML background feature. 
: The UML diagrams were created with reference to the tutoring center as well as the UML diagram slides. 
: Keeping the Single Responsibility design principle in mind. All the funcitons from password, generating username, login pages, etc are constructed in separate classes. 
: User info is stored using a hashmap as a key-value pair.
