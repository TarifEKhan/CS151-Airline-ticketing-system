Airline Ticketing System

Team members working on the proposal: Nguyen Chau, Jatesh Joshi, Tarif Khan

Problem Statement: 
Current airline ticketing systems are complicated and do not leave crucial decisions up to the users to make. For example, a normal flight booking website will show you the flight hours and layover hours but will not let you choose in what window or between how many hours you want the layover to be. Also, there are often overbooking issues and uncalled-for price fluctuations. Our product looks to solve these problems while keeping user data secure.

Previous works in the field:
There have been different projects and initiatives to modernize the current airline ticketing systems. Airlines such as United Airlines, Air France, and others are modernizing their systems with advanced cloud-based databases. However, their focus is not on giving the consumers a tailor-made experience.

Assumptions/Operating Environments/Intended Usage
The process of airline bookings can be a complex one if not properly kept track of. The intended usage of the Airline Ticketing System can be extended to both the clients and the implementing parties. The providers who are various airlines, private broker flight businesses, etc can use this system to provide schedules and fares along with a database of information including meal plans, packages, etc to their clients who will then decide what service they want to utilize based on their specific needs and preferences. The intended users can range from any common civilian to organizations that specialize in flight booking and managing operations. 

High-Level Description of Solution:
The Airline ticketing is a Java-based application. Our goal is to streamline the process of booking and managing airline tickets. The system will provide users with a user-friendly interface to search for flights, book tickets, and manage various aspects of their reservations such as flight cancellation, changing reservations, etc.

Functionality:
Primary functionalities are as follows:

i. User profile creation: Users will input their name, email, birthdate, and passport number to create their profile.

ii. Flight search and booking: Users will be able to search for flights based on their desired date, location, price, and layover duration. Users can then book their flights.

iii. Reservation management: After booking, users will be able to cancel or change their reservation.

Operations:
Here are the operations our users will be able to perform:

Search flights based on these criteria:

 i. Date

 iii. Layover duration

 iv. price

Change the following aspects of their reservation:
